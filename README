Gnome-emacs-utils
=================

This is a set of Emacs Lisp utilities to help Gnome developers.  It
has the following features:

* Teach Emacs about Mallard documents.


License
=======

Gnome-emacs-utils is distributed under the GNU General Public License
version 2 or later.  See the file COPYING for details.


Installation
============

The main Emacs file is gnome-emacs-utils.el.  You can put this in your
.emacs to load this file:

(load-library "/home/you/src/gnome-emacs-utils/gnome-emacs-utils.el")

Be sure to use the correct pathname, of course :)  If you know of a more
elegant way to load that elisp, please tweak this README file!


Wanted features
===============

* Have a way of bringing up Yelp with documentation for the function
  at the point.  This is easy for C functions with full names like
  gtk_window_set_title, and harder for languages that let you
  access methods as mywindow.set_title.

* Add a hotkey so that inline API docs can be created easily when you
  are editing a public function.  For example, imagine you are in the
  following code and the point is at [*]:

     GtkSandwich *
     gtk_foo_make_me_a_sandwich (GtkFoo *foo, GList *ingredients, GError **error)
     {
         [*]

  Then you press that hotkey, and the following documentation template
  is added:

     /**
      * gtk_foo_make_me_a_sandwich:
      * foo: 
      * ingredients:
      * error:
      *
      * Put the description here.
      *
      * Return value: 
      **/
     GtkSandwich *
     gtk_foo_make_me_a_sandwich (GtkFoo *foo, GList *ingredients, GError **error)
     {

  We used to have this in Gnome 1.x; see gnome-doc.el.  Try to revive
  this code!

* Now that we have gobject-introspection, use one of Emacs's
  typing completion libraries to implement "IntelliSense for Gnome
  functions":
